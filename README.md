This example requires you to install some tool for rust.
```
cargo install sfz
cargo install wasm-bindget
cargo install wasm-pack
rustup toolchain install wasm32-unknown-unknown
```
Run: `run.sh`
sfz will serve the files for you and you will acces them on `127.0.0.1:5000/html/index.html`

Press f12 to open console to se result.

THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE EXAMPLE.
Only to get you started to figure out on your own what can be done.
